# What and why is `mirobody/res/EXTERNAL.tsv`, which this script reads rather
# than restating: one table, so the checksums a download is verified against
# and the checksums a reader sees are the same characters.
#
# Called by `./deploy.sh` and by CI. Safe to re-run: a file that is present
# and whose checksum matches is left alone, so this costs one `stat` and one
# hash on every boot after the first.
#
# It does NOT fail the caller when a download fails. The one `runtime` file
# degrades to a warning in `collect/query.py` (semantic search falls back to the
# lexical index), and a deployment that cannot reach github.com must still
# come up — that is the whole point of the offline resolver.
