"""The blocks a turn streams, named the way LangChain names them.

`langchain_core.messages.content` defines a standard vocabulary for what a
model emits: ``text`` carries ``text``, ``reasoning`` carries ``reasoning``, a
``tool_call`` carries ``id`` / ``name`` / ``args``, and a tool's answer is a
``ToolMessage`` with ``tool_call_id`` and ``content``. This module uses those
names. What came before was ``reply`` / ``thinking`` / ``queryTitle`` /
``queryArguments`` / ``queryDetail`` / ``costStatistics``, invented here, so
every reader had to learn a private dialect to see the same five things.

Five block types have no LangChain equivalent because they are about the
stream rather than the model: ``start`` opens it with the id the answer will
be saved under, ``heartbeat`` keeps a proxy from closing an idle connection,
``notice`` is the system talking to the user, ``error`` is a fault the user is
told about, and ``end`` says why the turn stopped. ``interrupt`` is
LangGraph's: a paused run, with the pending call under its own name and
arguments.

Stdlib only. The chat layer imports this to read its stored transcripts, and
that must not drag LangChain into a process that only serves history.
